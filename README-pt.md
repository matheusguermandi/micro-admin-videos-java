## Tools required

-JDK 17
- IDE of your choice
- Docker

## How to run?

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/codeedu/micro-admin-videos-java.git
```

2. Upload the MySQL database with Docker:
``` shell
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Perform MySQL migrations with Flyway:
``` shell
./gradlew flywayMigrate
```

4. Run the application as a SpringBoot app:
``` shell
GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=A \
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=A \
./gradlew bootRun
```

> It is also possible to run as a Java application through the
> main() method in Main.java class
## Database
The main database is a MySQL and to upload it locally we will use
Docker. Run the following command to bring up MySQL:

``` shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Ready! Wait that in a moment MySQL will be ready to be consumed
on port 3306.

### Database Migrations with Flyway

#### Run the migrations

If it is the first time you are uploading the database, it is necessary
running the SQL migrations with the `flyway` tool.
Run the following command to run the migrations:

``` shell
./gradlew flywayMigrate
```

Ready! Now the MySQL database is ready to be used.

<br/>

#### Clear database migrations

It is possible to clean (delete all tables) your database, just
run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew flywayClear
```

BUT remember: "With great power comes great responsibility".

<br/>

#### Repairing database migrations

There are two ways to generate an inconsistency in the Flyway leaving it in the transformed state:

1. Some migration SQL file with error;
2. Some already applied migration file has been changed (by modifying the `checksum`).

When this happens, the flyway will be in a controlled state.
with a record in the `flyway_schema_history` table in error (`success = 0`).

To run the build, fix the files and run:
``` shell
./gradlew flywayRepair
```

With the above command, Flyway will clean the records with error from the `flyway_schema_history` table,
then execute the FlywayMigrate command to try to migrate them again.

<br/>

#### Other useful Flyway commands

In addition to the commands already shown, we have some other very useful ones such as info and validate:

``` shell
./gradlew flywayInfo
./gradlew flywayValidate
```

To know all available commands: [Flyway Gradle Plugin](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/usage/gradle/info)

<br/>

#### To run the commands in another environment

There in `build.gradle` we configure Flyway to first read the variables from
environment `FLYWAY_DB`, `FLYWAY_USER` and `FLYWAY_PASS` and then use a default value
if you can't find it. With that, to point to another environment just overwrite
these variables when executing the commands, for example:

``` shell
FLYWAY_DB=jdbc:mysql://prod:3306/adm_videos FLYWAY_USER=root FLYWAY_PASS=123h1hu ./gradlew flywayValidate
```

### Running with Docker
To run the application locally with Docker, we will use `docker compose` and it only takes three steps:
<br/>

#### 1. Generating the productive extractor (jar)

To generate the productive output, just run the command:
```
./gradlew bootJar
```
<br/>

#### 2. Running the independent containers

To run MySQL and Rabbit, just run the command below.
```
docker-compose up -d
```
<br/>

#### 3. Running the application along with other containers

After seeing that the other containers are up, to run your application together, just run the command:
```
docker-compose --profile app up -d
```

> **Note:** If you need to rebuild the image of your application, an additional command is required:
>```
> docker compose build --no-cache app
>```
#### Stopping containers
To close the containers, just run the command:
```
docker compose --stop profiling app
```
